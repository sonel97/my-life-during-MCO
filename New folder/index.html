<h1>The crazy not  so crazy maybe crazy story during MCO</h1>
    <p>It would be a lie if I told people I was being productive during all of this, then again when have I ever been productive. For the first week, my days are consist of sleeping, eating, playing game and sharing meme in faceboook. It was no different from what I have been doing all this time minus the going to class part..</p>

    <p> It was fun and all but eventually I got bored and wanted to try to do something else and not so suprising i end up doing other thing besides doing actual school work. I decided that i want to learn to cook, even as far as looking for easy recipe to do. Then it struck me, how in the world I’m going to cook when I’m stuck in campus. At that moment I question my existance as a human. Am I going insane already, guess not..</p>

    <p>	A few day later I start to realize that I sweat a lot just by doing little stuff like walking to the dining hall to take my food which was provided. I started thinking to myself, I need to get in shape, maybe this was the opportunities for me to get in shape, which eventually I did three day later. I start up with the basic exercise I found online and gave up midway because in my mine it was too boring. I look for dancing video afterward due to my passion on dancing. I’m not good at it but proud enough that I can dance a little. In the span of four day I learn three different choreography and learn how to do the moon walk. That was a fun week.</p>
